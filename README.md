# iTALK
`iTALK` is an R toolkit for characterizing and illustrating intercellular communication, developed and maintained by [Linghua Wang lab](https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/labs/linghua-wang-laboratory.html) at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. `iTALK` can be used to visualize the complexity, diversity and dynamics of cell-cell communication in a wide range of biological processes. For more information, please refer to [our manuscript]().
